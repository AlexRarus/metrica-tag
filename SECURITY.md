### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects metrica-tag


### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by metrica-tag maintainers within 5
working days. As the security issue moves from triage, to identified fix, to
release planning we will keep the reporter updated.


## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the metrica-tag maintainers and the bug
submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user
mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or
the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for
vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate to 90 days.
For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to
disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days.
